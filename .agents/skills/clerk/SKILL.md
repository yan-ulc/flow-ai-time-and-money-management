  Operate the Clerk CLI (`clerk` binary) for authentication, user/org/session management,
  instance config, env keys, and any Clerk Backend or Platform API call. Use when the user
  mentions Clerk management tasks, "list clerk users", "create a clerk user", "update
  organization", "pull clerk config", "clerk env pull", "clerk doctor", "clerk api", or
  any ad-hoc Clerk API request. Prefer the CLI over raw HTTP: it handles auth, key
  resolution, app/instance targeting, and formatting automatically.

# Clerk CLI

The `clerk` binary is a pre-authenticated gateway to Clerk's Backend API and Platform API, plus project-level tooling (auth, linking, env pulls, instance config). When the user asks anything that touches a Clerk resource, reach for `clerk` first instead of hand-rolling `curl`.

> This skill was installed by `clerk init` (or `clerk skill install`) and is pinned to clerk `1.0.3`. If `clerk --version` disagrees, refresh it with `clerk skill install` (or `bunx clerk@1.0.3 skill install`). The binary is always the source of truth, so run `clerk <command> --help` to verify anything this skill claims.

## Execution environment (prefer the host, understand the sandbox warning)

Most AI coding agents default to running shell commands in a sandbox where the
user's home directory, OS keychain, browser launch, localhost callback
binding, or network access may be blocked. The Clerk CLI depends on all of
those host capabilities:

- **OS credential store**: `clerk auth login` stores the OAuth token in the
  system keychain. A sandbox without keychain access reports "not logged in"
  even when the host is authenticated.
- **Home-directory Clerk state**: saved config, cached metadata, and fallback
  credentials live under the user's Clerk config/data directories.
- **Linked project metadata**: resolved from the repo's git remote plus Clerk
  config. Sandboxes with stripped repo state or blocked home-dir reads can
  misreport "not linked".
- **Local `.env*` files**: publishable and secret keys materialized by
  `clerk env pull`.
- **Outbound network access to Clerk**: every Backend and Platform API call.
- **Browser + localhost OAuth callback**: `clerk auth login` needs both.

In agent mode, the CLI now does a **best-effort warn-once check** at the
host-sensitive library boundaries. When it detects that host-only Clerk state
or system capabilities are unavailable, it emits:

```text
Host-only Clerk state or system capabilities may be unavailable in agent mode. This may be a sandboxed run.
Re-run this command on the host shell before trusting auth, link, env, or API failures.
```

Treat that warning as authoritative. The command may continue, but any auth,
link, env, config, API, browser, or OAuth callback failure from that
invocation is untrusted until you rerun the same command on the host.

**Prefer these commands on the user's host shell, not in a sandbox:**

`clerk doctor`, `clerk whoami`, `clerk auth login`, `clerk link`, `clerk env pull`,
`clerk apps ...`, `clerk config ...`, `clerk api ...`.

If a command was accidentally run in a sandbox and it reports `Not logged in`,
`auth_required`, `not linked`, missing env, keychain/file permission errors,
or network failures, **do not treat the result as authoritative**. Rerun it on
the host before acting on it or reporting it to the user.

## Invoking the CLI

Before running any `clerk` command, figure out which binary to invoke and bind that choice for the rest of the session:

```sh
# 1. Prefer a globally installed binary when it matches the skill's pinned version.
command -v clerk >/dev/null 2>&1 && clerk --version
```

If that prints `1.0.3` (or any version you trust), use bare `clerk` for the rest of the session.

Otherwise fall back to a package runner, in this order (matches the CLI's own `preferredRunner` logic, which prefers the runner that matches the project's lockfile):

| Project package manager   | Invocation                       |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| bun (`bun.lock*`)         | `bunx clerk@1.0.3`     |
| npm (`package-lock.json`) | `npx -y clerk@1.0.3`   |
| pnpm (`pnpm-lock.yaml`)   | `pnpm dlx clerk@1.0.3` |
| yarn >= 2 (`yarn.lock`)   | `yarn dlx clerk@1.0.3` |

Yarn Classic (v1) has no `dlx`; treat those projects as "no preferred runner" and fall back to the first runner from the list above that's on PATH.

The published npm package is **`clerk`**, not `@clerk/cli`. Never teach `npm install -g clerk` as the primary path. The bundled skill is versioned alongside the binary, so a globally installed mismatched version will drift. If `clerk --version` disagrees with `1.0.3`, either upgrade the global install or fall back to the pinned-runner form above.

## Prerequisites (run at session start)

Before running any other Clerk command in a session, verify the CLI is authenticated, linked, and healthy:

```sh
clerk --version               # confirm the binary is on PATH
clerk doctor --json           # structured health check; exit 1 if anything failed
```

**Always run `clerk doctor --json` first.** It catches the common setup failures (not logged in, project not linked, missing keys, outdated bundled skill) up front, so later commands don't fail with confusing errors. In agent mode it also includes a `Host execution` check that warns when Clerk's host-side config / credential directories are not writable, which is the canonical signal that the current invocation is likely sandboxed.

Each result has `name`, `status` (`pass`/`warn`/`fail`), `message`, optional `detail`, optional `remedy` (how to fix it), and optional `fix` (label for auto-fixable issues). Parse that and act on it, or surface it to the user. If `Host execution` warns, rerun the command on the host before trusting any auth/link/env/API failures from the same sandboxed run. Rerun `clerk doctor --json` whenever a later command starts misbehaving.

If `clerk skill --help` reports a newer CLI than the skill you're reading, run `clerk skill install` to refresh the bundled skill. The CLI binary is always the source of truth.

## The mental model

| Layer                           | What it does                                                                                 | Commands                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Session / project**           | Auth, link a repo to a Clerk app, pull env keys                                              | `auth login`, `link`, `unlink`, `whoami`, `env pull`, `doctor` |
| **Instance config**             | Manage the configuration (social providers, session lifetimes, etc.) for a specific instance | `config pull`, `config schema`, `config patch`, `config put`   |
| **Backend API (default)**       | Runtime data: users, orgs, sessions, invitations, JWT templates, webhooks                    | `clerk api <path>`                                             |
| **Platform API (`--platform`)** | Account-level: applications, instances, billing                                              | `clerk api --platform <path>`                                  |

A project is "linked" to an application via `clerk link`. Once linked, most commands auto-resolve the target app and dev instance from the repo's git remote. To target something else, pass `--app <id>` and/or `--instance dev|prod|<instance_id>`. See [references/auth.md](references/auth.md) for the full resolution order.

## Discover endpoints — don't memorize them

The CLI ships with the Clerk OpenAPI catalog. Always discover endpoints dynamically instead of guessing paths:

```sh
clerk api ls                  # list every Backend API endpoint
clerk api ls users            # filter by keyword (matches path, summary, tag, operationId)
clerk api ls --platform apps  # list Platform API endpoints
```

Use this before `clerk api <path>`. If you don't see the endpoint you expected, it probably isn't exposed.

## The `clerk api` command (the workhorse)

`clerk api` makes authenticated HTTP calls. It auto-resolves keys, auto-detects method from body presence, supports stdin, and can preview mutations with `--dry-run`.

```sh
# GET requests
clerk api /users                                  # list users
clerk api /users/user_abc123                      # fetch one
clerk api /users?limit=5&order_by=-created_at     # query params work inline

# Mutating requests
clerk api /users -d '{"email_address":["a@b.co"]}'          # POST (auto-detected from body)
clerk api /users/user_abc123 -X PATCH -d '{"first_name":"A"}'
clerk api /users/user_abc123 -X DELETE

# Body from file or stdin
clerk api /users --file payload.json
cat payload.json | clerk api /users

# Always preview mutations first
clerk api /users/user_abc123 -X DELETE --dry-run
clerk api /users/user_abc123 -X DELETE --yes      # skip confirmation once you've verified

# Target a specific app/instance
clerk api /users --app app_abc123 --instance prod

# Include response headers when debugging
clerk api /users --include

# Platform API (account-level, not tenant data)
clerk api /v1/platform/applications --platform
```

For instance config, prefer the dedicated `clerk config ...` commands over raw Platform API `/config` paths. They handle dry-run, diffing, and confirmation more cleanly than the raw endpoint form.

**Always `--dry-run` a mutation before running it for real.** Then re-run without `--dry-run` (add `--yes` if you're sure). In agent mode, interactive confirmation is bypassed, so `--dry-run` is the only safety net for destructive calls.

**JSON bodies must be valid JSON.** The CLI validates and rejects malformed payloads.

**Endpoint paths may be given with or without `/v1/` prefix** — both work for Backend API calls. The CLI normalizes.

See [references/recipes.md](references/recipes.md) for concrete patterns: listing/filtering users, creating orgs, impersonation sessions, etc.

Run after upgrading the CLI so the skill matches the new binary.                                                                                            | `-y`, `--pm`                                                                                                 |

**`clerk <command> --help` is the source of truth for flags.** This table is a hint, not a spec. Before running an unfamiliar command or flag combination, run `clerk <command> --help` once per session. Every command also defines `setExamples([...])` in source, which `--help` renders as a copy-pasteable Examples block, so you rarely need to guess syntax.

## Agent-mode behavior (important)

The CLI auto-detects agent mode when stdout is not a TTY, or when `--mode agent` / `CLERK_MODE=agent` is set. In agent mode:

- **Interactive prompts are disabled.** Commands that would normally show pickers (`link` without `--app`, interactive `api`, `unlink` without `--yes`) either auto-resolve or exit with a usage error. Always pass explicit flags (`--app`, `--yes`) in scripted calls.
- **Host-sensitive operations emit a sandbox warning once per invocation.** Home-directory Clerk state, keychain access, networked Clerk calls, browser launch, and localhost OAuth callback setup can trigger the warning shown above. If it appears, rerun the same command on the host before trusting the result.
- **If your harness does not clearly present as agent mode, force it.** Use `--mode agent` or `CLERK_MODE=agent` when you want the CLI's non-interactive behavior and sandbox warning path to apply deterministically.
- **`link` supports deterministic agent flows.** In agent mode, `clerk link --app <id>` links directly. Without `--app`, the CLI will try silent key-based autolink first; if it cannot determine the app unambiguously, it exits and tells you to pass `--app`.
- **`unlink` requires `--yes` in agent mode.** This preserves the same safety bar as other destructive commands while still letting an agent complete the unlink non-interactively.
- **Mutations still require `--yes`** unless you accept per-call confirmation is impossible.
- **`doctor --fix` is ignored.** Parse `doctor --json` output's `remedy` field and act on it yourself.
- **`apps list` and `apps create` default to JSON** when piped.
- **`clerk init --prompt`** prints a short agent-oriented handoff telling the agent to run `clerk init -y` (it is NOT a framework-specific integration guide; use the runtime `clerk init` output itself for that).

## Output format and errors

- **JSON output:** `--json` on `apps list` and `doctor`. For `clerk api`, the response body is the raw API JSON, so pipe into `jq` freely.
- **Exit codes:** `0` success, `1` runtime error, `2` usage/validation error. `doctor` returns `1` if any check failed.
- **Error format:** User-facing errors print a single line to stderr and set a non-zero exit code. Use `--verbose` for stack traces when debugging.

## Safety rules for autonomous use

1. **Discover before acting:** `clerk api ls <keyword>` before `clerk api <path>`.
2. **Preview mutations:** `--dry-run` on every `config patch`, `config put`, `api -X POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE`.
3. **Target explicitly in production:** pass `--instance prod` rather than relying on defaults, and confirm with the user before any production mutation.
4. **Never commit secrets:** `env pull` writes to `.env.local` (which should be gitignored). Don't paste secret keys into code or chat.
5. **Use `doctor --json`** to diagnose before assuming the CLI is broken.
